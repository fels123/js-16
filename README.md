# Exercise: Adding Elements

For this exercise, you should add some elements to the DOM via JavaScript.

To be precise, you must add two "course goal" items => two <li> items to the <ul> that already exists on the page:

The first course goal <li> that's added via JavaScript should contain the text "Learn JavaScript" (without quotes)

The second goal <li> item should contain the text "Master JavaScript" (also without quotes)

Again: You must do this via JavaScript, NOT by editing the HTML code!

Important: Put all your DOM editing code into the pre-defined solve() function.
